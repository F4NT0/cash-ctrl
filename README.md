# Cash-Ctrl

> Personal finance control tool — terminal UI powered by Spectre.Console.

---

## Overview

**Cash-Ctrl** is a minimalist TUI (Terminal User Interface) application for tracking personal expenses and income, stored as structured JSON files called *controls*.

Each control represents a financial period (e.g., "Junho 2026") and holds a starting balance, expenses, and incomes. The app runs fully in the terminal with a clean purple-on-black aesthetic.

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — TUI installer (recommended)

Download `cash-ctrl.exe` from `dist/`, place it anywhere, then run:

```powershell
.\cash-ctrl.exe --install
```

The TUI installer will:
1. Let you choose the install directory (default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CashCtrl`)
2. Copy `cash-ctrl.exe` to that directory
3. Add the directory to your **user PATH** automatically

Open a new terminal and you can use `cash-ctrl` from anywhere.

### Option 2 — Manual

1. Copy `dist/cash-ctrl.exe` to a folder of your choice (e.g. `C:\Tools`)
2. Add that folder to your user PATH:
   - Open **Start → Edit environment variables for your account**
   - Edit `Path` → add the folder

### Option 3 — Build from source

```powershell
# Requires .NET 10 SDK
dotnet publish CashCtrl\CashCtrl.csproj -c Release -o dist
.\dist\cash-ctrl.exe --install
```

---

## Usage

```
cash-ctrl                  Open the main welcome menu
cash-ctrl <name>           Open or create a control by name in the current directory
cash-ctrl .                Browse controls in the current directory
cash-ctrl --install        Run the TUI installer (add cash-ctrl to PATH)
cash-ctrl --help           Show this help message

## Screens

### Welcome screen
Shows the `CASH-CTRL` figlet logo and a keyboard-navigable menu:
- **Open controls…** — select from recently opened or local controls
- **Create new control** — wizard to create a new `.json` control file

Navigation: `↑↓` select · `Enter` confirm · `Esc` quit

### Create new Control
Step-by-step form:
1. Control name (becomes the filename, e.g. `Junho-2026.json`)
2. Auto-preview of the save path
3. Starting balance (in BRL)

### Open Control
Preview panel showing the control name, total balance, and file path. Confirm with `Enter`, cancel with `Esc`.

### Main screen
Full-screen TUI with 3 columns at the top, a summary bar in the middle, and an entry list at the bottom.

**Top panels:**
- **Controls** — navigate between control files in the same directory
- **Expense types** — bar chart of spending by category
- **Calendar** — monthly calendar with colour-coded days (red = expense, green = income, purple = both)

**Middle bar:** Total Amount · Total Expenses · Available value · Clock

**Entry list:** Date · Name · Type · Amount · Origin — sortable, navigable, with detail view and delete mode

#### Main screen keyboard shortcuts

|---|---|
| `C` | Focus the controls panel |
| `I` | Edit the initial total balance |
| `T` | Add a new income |
| `E` | Add a new expense |

| `S` | Cycle calendar month (when entries span multiple months) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate focused panel |
| `Enter` | Confirm / open detail |
| `D` | Enter delete mode (in list) |
| `Space` | Mark entry for deletion (in delete mode) |
| `Esc` | Cancel / exit focus / quit |

### New Expense modal

- Press `+` to add line items with quantity, unit (Kg / Un), and per-item price
- Amount is calculated automatically for Kg items

### New Income modal

## Control file format

Controls are plain `.json` files stored wherever you create them.

```json
{
  "Junho 2026": {
    "total-value": 25000.00,
    "Fruteirão": {
      "date": "01/06/2026",
      "total": 25.00,
      "type": "fruteira",
      "type-color": "#FF6B6B",
      "description": "Fruteirão",
      "origin": "expense",
      "details": [
        {
          "name": "banana",
          "amount": 10.00,
          "item-price": 5.00,
          "quantity": 2,
          "size": "Kg"
        }
      ]
    },
    "Salário": {
      "date": "05/06/2026",
      "total": 5000.00,
      "description": "Salário",
      "origin": "income",
      "details": []
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `total-value` | Starting balance for the period |
| `origin` | `"expense"` (money out) or `"income"` (money in) |
| `type` / `type-color` | Expense category and its chart color |
| `description` | Display name shown in the entry list |
| `details` | Line items (optional). Each item has `name`, `amount`, `quantity`, `size` (`Kg`/`Un`), and optionally `item-price` |

Favorites and recents are stored in: `%APPDATA%\CashCtrl\favorites.json`
